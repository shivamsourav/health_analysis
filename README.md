 # Liver Disease Data Analysis using Power BI
 # Table of Contents

# Introduction
This project involves analyzing liver disease data obtained from Kaggle to uncover insights and patterns. The analysis is conducted using Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool. The main objective is to identify key factors contributing to liver disease and present the findings in an easily interpretable format.

# Dataset Information
The dataset used for this analysis is the "Indian Liver Patient Dataset" from Kaggle. It contains information about liver patients and healthy individuals. The dataset includes the following columns:

Age: Age of the patient
Gender: Gender of the patient
smoking: Yes / No
BMI : BMI level
Genetics disease : Yes/No
%Alcohol consumption : Alcohol consumption percentage per week.
LFT : Liver function test report


# Installation and Setup
Download the dataset from Kaggle:

Visit Kaggle and download the dataset.
Save the dataset to your local machine.
Install Power BI Desktop:

# Download and install Power BI Desktop from the official Power BI website.
   # Data Preprocessing
Before importing the dataset into Power BI, some preprocessing steps might be necessary. These steps include:

 # Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values appropriately.
Correct any data inconsistencies or errors.
Feature Engineering:
Create new features if necessary to enhance the analysis.
Data Transformation:
Normalize or standardize data if required.
You can use Python or any other data processing tool to perform these steps. Save the cleaned and preprocessed data as a CSV file.
Power BI Analysis
Import Data:

# Open Power BI Desktop.
Click on Get Data and select the preprocessed CSV file.
Data Visualization:

Use various visualization tools provided by Power BI to create charts, graphs, and other visual elements.
Recommended visualizations:
Age distribution of liver patients.
Gender distribution among liver patients.
Correlation between different biochemical parameters and liver disease.
Distribution of biochemical parameters among liver patients and healthy individuals.
Interactive Dashboard:

Create an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter and explore the data dynamically.
Include slicers for age, gender, and other relevant fields.
Results and Insights
After completing the data analysis in Power BI, document the key findings and insights:

Identify significant patterns or trends in the data.
Highlight factors that have a strong correlation with liver disease.
Provide any recommendations or observations based on the analysis.
# Conclusion
Summarize the analysis and its importance. Discuss how the insights obtained can be used for further research or practical applications in the medical field.
